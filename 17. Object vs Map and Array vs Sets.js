//=============================== Object vs Maps  and  Arrays vs Sets ====================================
//which data structure to use


//Source of Data
//1. from the program it self .  writen statically in function or program
//2. from DOM ,  data is being coming from input or anything
//3. from API ,  from any other  Application Programing interface

//it can be
//1. Collection of Data
//2. Data Strucatur

//Design
//1. if  we need  simple list of Values then   ====> Array or Sets
//2. if we need key value pair   ============> Object or Map


//============== Array vs  Sets ====================

//------- Array ----------
//1. use when you need ordered list of value (might contain duplicates)
//2. use when you need to manipulate data

//------- Sets ----------
//1. use when you need to work with unique vlaues
//2. Use when hight-performance is realy important
//3. use to remove duplicates from arrays


//============== obj vs Map ====================

//------- Array ----------
//1. More 'traditional' key/value store (abused objects)
//2. Easier to write and accesss value with . and []

//=> Use When you need to  include function (method)
//=> Use when  working with JSON (can convert to map)

//------- Maps ----------
//1. Better performance
//2. key can have any data type
//3. Easy to iterate
//4. Easy to compute size


//=> use when you simple need to map key to values
//=> Use when you need keys that are not strings
